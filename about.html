<p>안녕하세요 Hello,
<br />I am a software developer experienced in Ruby/Rails, JavaScript, React, Google Firebase and design principles. I strive to write simple reusable code, collaborate with other developers, learn new technologies and express creativity. My most recent project is a React app for pet owners, allowing users to keep track of important dates and notes on all their pets. My projects can be found at https://github.com/3Mustard and http://3mustard.pythonanywhere.com/</p>

<p>When I'm not coding I enjoy learning new things, reading, playing with my cats, computer games and good food. I have been studying Korean and hope to travel there in the future.</p>

<p>I am currently open to new job opportunities so if you are a recruiter or know anyone who is hiring please reach out to me by email at m23.cullen@gmail.com OR phone at 585-831-0531.</p>
