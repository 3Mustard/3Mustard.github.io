My first project during my cohort at Flatiron School was to build a Ruby cli gem that used data scraped from the internet using the nokogiri gem. Getting through this project required being comfortable with all the basic Ruby skills as well as object oriented programming. The trickiest part was getting the correct data with nokogiri. I used binding.pry to help stop my code and explore the data returned by nokogiri. My completed project was a Ruby gem that scraped a deck of fortune card data, made a ruby object for each card/deck and printed fortunes to the console. Upon completion I felt I had a good understanding of looping, logic and conditionals, iteration, data structures, and object oriented programming in Ruby.
