My first project turned out pretty good but due to early problems with my enviroment I found myself spending more time fixing issues unrelated to my code. I started off confident in my ability to complete the project and spent the first day and a half procrastinating. When I sat down to start I discovered I couldn't get my code editor to locate any files and decided to reinstall it and walk through the enviroment set up again. After this problem was solved I began to code only to discover that I kept getting an error "bundle 2 is required" I checked and I had bundle 2 and had initialized my project with it. After googling my issue and trying a couple of things things were back on track but I had spent so much time messing around with stuff that wasn't part of my project that I began to stress about getting a minimun viable product out. 
Well the weekend came and I worked through most of it to get out a project I was satisfied with. Not completly satisfied, as there were things I wanted to add to my gem but I was satisfied that I had created my first working gem. I felt comfortable with the coding aspect but had to learn more about how my files were communicating with each other. Going forward in my course I plan to start things early so if I hit a roadblock I'm not miles behind where I would like to be.
