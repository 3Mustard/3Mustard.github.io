"Materialize is a UI component library created with CSS, JavaScript, and HTML. Materialize UI components help in constructing attractive, consistent, and functional web pages and web apps, while adhering to modern web design principles such as browser portability, device independence, and graceful degradation."

**examples:**
[Github of examples](https://github.com/3Mustard/materializecssTutorial)
[Github of website designed with materialize](https://github.com/3Mustard/website-template-materializecss)

**Setup** 
add links to the materialize stylesheet, javaScript and google font images found [here](https://materializecss.com/getting-started.html)

**Why I enjoy using it**
* opinionated about how elements should look and behave according to design principles followed by google
* beautiful design with out of the box custom class
* easy to use
* supports responsive design 
* plenty of documentation 
* ruby gem for additional quick implementation 
* open source

Example of usage:

-Adding a class provided by materialize like "container"
``` <div class="container">anything in a class container has custom margins</div>```
