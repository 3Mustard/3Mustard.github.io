For my Final project I made an app for people with exotic pets to keep track of feedings and other important information. It took me too long to think of an idea for this project. 

I find setting up the api first to be the best approach as you get to fine tune what kind of data is being sent to the client.

Before creating my react part of the project I took out a notebook and sketched out how I wanted things to look and flow from component to component. I think planning before you sit down to code is the best strategy as you can discover/ avoid future issues. 

Running into problems in React as opposed to the last project with pure javascript involved thinking about my redux store and if my reducer was properly returning the correct data to my component. Aside from that my normal method of console logging my variables/props and inserting binding.pry into my backend proved more than efficient for fixing problems.

My biggest struggle was understanding redux which takes state and passes it down to a component and it's children.
I had trouble applying bootstrap styles as I did with my previous projects so my styling suffered and I hope to fix it soon.

Moving foreward Iâ€™d like to improve my css skills more and try out another web framework like angular.
