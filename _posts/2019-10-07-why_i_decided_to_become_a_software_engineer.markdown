I spend a lot of time Youtube, too much time maybe. I was watching a comedy/tech channel and one of the sponsors was a site offering free coding courses to beginners. I decided to check it out and it felt natural to me from the start. I spent the next couple months learning as a hobby from various online resources and books. At this point in my life I was ready to make a career move, I was enjoying coding but wanted a way to level up fast and make it a career. I was looking for a structured format to learn some of the popular technologies being used while actually building apps, working with other people and having support from experienced programmers. I found all of this and more at Flatiron Schools full time software engineering bootcamp. After graduating I felt confident in my skills as a developer and my ability to continue learning and growing in this field.
