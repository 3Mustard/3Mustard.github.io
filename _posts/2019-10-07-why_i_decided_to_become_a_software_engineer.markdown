I started learning to code as a hobby on freecodeacademy because I enjoy computers, building things, and being creative. A friend of mine in the field suggested that if I enjoyed coding that I could become a developer without going to a traditional college. I was 29 at the time and going back to college for 2+ years wasn't something I wanted to do. I spent a couple more months learning code to prove to myself it was something I could do and enjoy. During this time a couple friends I know who are software developers suggested I look into bootcamps. While I am hoping to find a job quickly I ultimatly decided to attend a full time bootcamp in order to immerse myself in coding and build a strong foundation for myself.
