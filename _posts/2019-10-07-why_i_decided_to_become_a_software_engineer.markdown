I was sick of working entry level jobs about half way through my twenties but I still didn't know what I'd rather be doing to earn an income. My friend was learning to code and graduating from a four year school when he suggested I try coding with the various free resources online. I had no job at the time and all the free time to persue something more. I started learning python/html/css and javascript on codeacademy and after I had gotten through each course I worked with my friend do build my first web app. 

The creative outlet I found in coding during these first couple months inspired me to start reading how people got into the field without going to college. I read several articles for and against bootcamps but ultimatly decided that attending one would be in my best interest. After a month of thinking about and researching various bootcamps I applied to Flatiron school.
