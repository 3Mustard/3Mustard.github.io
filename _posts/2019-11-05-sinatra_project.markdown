I feels good to actually build a working web application. Aside from understanding how to write code I also gained a lot of knowledge in how urls send requests to execute crud functions. crud being create,render,update and destroy. The mvc structure was interesting, when I started learning to code I was curious how all the files in larger and larger applications communicate and are structured. The model, view, controller structure made a lot of sense. The models are responisble for connecting to a table in a database, the controller is used to get objects from the model and send them to the view to display to a user. I am proud of how far I have come in such a short amount of time.
